## üèÜ Honorable Mentions

These are apps I used to use and would still recommend, but simply don't fit my needs at the moment.

* [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com) - I used to use Adobe's tools for being creative. Then I got annoyed at the cost. But they're still the industry standard.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - The gold standard of app launchers/multi-tools. I used this extensively before switching to Raycast, which has more of a developer orientation.
* [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) - Writing notebook. Where ideas go to germinate. It's great! It's just that Apple Notes is also pretty great, and does pretty much everything I need Drafts for.
* [Hookshot](https://hookshot.app) - A mouse/gesture-based window manager. I always have one installed and then almost never use it. This I started using right away. Then I realized the only things I used it for were built into Raycast. Still, it's my favorite of the window management tools that I've tried.
* [Nova](https://nova.app/) - Code editor and extremely capable text editor for HTML, CSS, Javascript, Php, Python, Markdown, etc... I'm now using VS Code pretty much exclusively, now.
* [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) - Markdown-based personal knowledge base. I still *want* to use it, but my note-taking has all moved to Apple Notes.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) - One of the most powerful task management apps in existence. I have recently switched back to Apple Reminders.
* [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) - A lovely color picker. Which I pretty much never actually used. Still lovely, though!
* [Tooth Fairy](https://c-command.com/toothfairy/) - Manage Bluetooth devices from the menu bar *easily*. Much of what I used it for is built into Monterey now.
* [Workspaces](https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) - Lets you launch multiple apps, files, URLs *per project*. As of Monterey, I have replaced this with Shortcuts. But if you want an app that's way easier to use than shortcuts, this is it.
