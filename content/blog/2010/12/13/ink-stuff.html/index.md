Go check out the new pen and ink blog Writing and Scribbling over atÂ [http://writingandscribbling.wordpress.com/](http://writingandscribbling.wordpress.com/). There are pen reviews, ink reviews, and some nice posts about journaling. It's always great to see new people join the fountain pen blogging community.

Also, I just received an order from the [Goulet Pen Company](http://www.gouletpens.com/). I picked up some large bottles of Diamine Ink, but the main reason for the order was the Noodler's Flex Nib Demonstrator pen. I will post some pictures and writing samples just as soon as I get a chance to play with it.
