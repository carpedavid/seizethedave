The 11th Carnival of Pen, Pencil and Paper is being hosted over at the [Tiger Pens blog](http://www.tigerpens.co.uk/blog/11th-carnival-of-pen-pencil-and-paper/). My review of J. Herbin’s 1670 ink is one of the editor’s picks! Be sure to stop by and read through all of the excellent pen, pencil, ink, and paper posts.
