For your snowy Friday afternoon reading pleasure:

- Leigh Reyes once again [puts us all to shame](http://www.leighreyes.com/blog/?p=3112) with her artistic abilities and demonstrates a wet-on-wet technique with water and fountain pens.
- Over at Ink Nouveau, Brian Goulet [lets us know](http://www.inknouveau.com/2011/02/noodlers-bernanke-black-and-blue-fast.html) about two new "fast dry" inks from Noodler's.
