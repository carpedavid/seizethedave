I'm experimenting with using SoundCloud to host audio versions of my poetry and short stories. You can check out my first experiment here: [http://soundcloud.com/carpedavid/the-fog](http://soundcloud.com/carpedavid/the-fog). It is a recording of my poem, "[Fog](/blog/2012/3/8/fog.html)."

Is this something, O gracious reader, that you'd find useful? Interesting? The recording above was made with my phone, so it doesn't have the best sound fidelity. If this is something that you all would enjoy, then I might invest in a nice microphone, and perhaps even recruit other readers.
