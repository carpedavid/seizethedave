I would burn for you if you asked me to.

I would douse myself in kerosene,

Light a match, and wrap myself in flames

So that I might join you in solidarity –

That I might join you in protest

Of a brutal and blameless man,

Who left you bruised and beaten outside and

Battered and broken inside and

Burning – so brightly burning – all over.
