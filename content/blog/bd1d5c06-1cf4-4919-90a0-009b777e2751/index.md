Anonymous asked:Dave,

Your blog name is the best blog name I have ever heard.

EVER.

Anyway, I really like the calligraphy you put at the beginning of each review. What style is that, and where did you learn it?

Ha - thanks!

The script I use at the beginning of my ink reviews is based on “italic flourished miniscule,” with a hefty amount of improvisation on my part. I found the instructions for it in a book called [The Calligrapher’s Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764156152?ie=UTF8&tag=seizethedav0c-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0764156152). Quite frankly, I wouldn’t be doing calligraphy at all if I hadn’t picked up that book. It’s a fantastic resource.
