I just finished and submitted a short story for an anthology, so now I can turn my attention back to content for this site. I've got a number of reviews and short stories patiently (or impatiently, in some cases) waiting to be written. Here's a quick run down:

1. Write a review of the [Platinum Carbon Fountain Pen](http://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Carbon-Desk-Fountain-Pen-Super-Fine-1-Carbon-Ink-Cartridge/pd/3851) (graciously provided by Jet Pens).
2. Finish the first installment of the second season of the [Sacred and the Profane](/the-sacred-and-the-profane/), my episodic fiction series.
3. Write a review of J. Herbin Bleu Pervenche.
4. Write a review of the Classic Clariefontaine Clothbound Notebook.
5. Start each of three short stories: Interview, The Last Page, and Strange Little Loops.

That's more or less the order I intend to tackle them in, but there's always the chance that a new ink review or story idea will lodge itself in my mind and demand to take priority. Ideas tend to do that. They're sneaky that way.
