*Your only child has been taken by goblins to the underground city of Ix, where they mine coal and tend to the great clockwork contraptions that run your perfect world.*

*You want to remember their name. You want to hold them in your arms, again. You want to bring them home.*

Journey into the Underground by yourself or with a team to find your child in this short, two-page TTRPG of urban fantasy. Explore a steam-powered world filled with goblins, monstrous clockwork gears, and endless spiral staircases.
