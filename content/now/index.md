Here's what I'm working on now...

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Work

Not every relationship lasts forever, including business relationships. Though we put together a rock-solid, superstar product and technology team at GlobalCastMD -- one that I'm confident will be able to deliver an incredible new medical knowledge-sharing platform -- I'm now looking for my next opportunity.

I've built and led teams that built world-class platforms across industries ranging from entertainment to logistics to fintech. So, if you or anyone you know is looking for a senior leader who drives excellence in product and technology delivery through intentional culture development and process engineering, [send me a note](mailto:carpedavid@gmail.com)!

## üè† Creative

* Just published a solo, journaling RPG about being chased through a dark and dangerous forest by a [Wendigo](https://www.heroictalesrpg.com/wendigo).
* A solo sci-fi game set in a post-war galaxy, powered by [Heroic Tales](https://heroictalesrpg.com).
* Porting the Land of the Crane setting over to the Heroic Tales rule-set.
* I'm also working on a hexcrawl/mega-dungeon XCOM-inspired campaign for 5E titled Gnomes of the Necropocalypse.
