The crane is considered to be the most iconic of all origami models. It's easy to learn and easy enough to fold - and the crane is considered to be a symbol of good luck and longevity. Consequently, a Japanese tradition states that someone who folds one thousand cranes will be granted either good luck or a wish. Traditionally, the [cranes are threaded together](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_origami_cranes) once they're folded, and then given as gifts or hung in one's own home.

I find the process of folding cranes to be meditative and rejuvenating - and I've been in need of a little meditation and rejuvenation in my life lately. Therefore, I've decided to embark on the journey of one thousand cranes, and to [record them all on tumblr](http://1kcranes.tumblr.com). I intend to fold at least one per day, which means that this should take a little under three years to complete. You are welcome to join me on my journey. You'll see lots of cranes and a few other origami models as well.
