The 9th Carnival of Pen, Pencil and Paper is being hosted by Nifty at [Notebook Stories](http://www.notebookstories.com/2010/04/06/carnival-of-pen-pencil-and-paper-9th-edition/). My J. Herbin Poussiere de Lune review is featured in the ink section. If youâ€™re into pens, pencils, paper, or ink, be sure to stop by and take a look.
