Here's what I'm working on now...

## 🧑🏽‍💻 Work

* I just joined the leadership team of [GlobalCast MD](https://globalcastmd.com), a growing health education company headquartered in Cleveland, OH. We empower medical pioneers and knowledge generators with the tools and platform to connect with practitioners from around the world.
* I'm happy to say that I'm hiring. I'm looking for an intermediate-level polyglot developer with experience in web and mobile. Fully remote. Our current tech stack is Laravel/Php on the web and Flutter/Dart on mobile.

## 🏠 Home

* I'm making progress revising the [Heroic Tales](https://heroictalesrpg.com) rules engine as I adapt and expand them for a sci-fi solo journaling game.
* I'm also working on a hexcrawl/mega-dungeon XCOM-inspired campaign for 5E titled Gnomes of the Necropocalypse.
