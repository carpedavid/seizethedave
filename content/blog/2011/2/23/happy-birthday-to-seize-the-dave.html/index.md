One year ago today, I started Seize the Dave over on tumblr, with a [poem about an octopus](/2010/02/octopus-would.html). Since then, I've written more [poetry](/search/label/poetry) and [short stories](/search/label/short%20stories) than I have in all of my prior years combined. I've met lots of awesome people in the pen and paper world and gotten the hang of writing [ink](/search/label/ink%20reviews) and [paper reviews](/search/label/paper%20reviews). I've participated in the Friday Flash fiction community and I've shared [origami](/search/label/origami) and [sketches](/search/label/art) of snails and walrus bees.

Each of these things was made possible by the people that read this blog - your encouragement and feedback have been invaluable, and I value all of the friendships I've made along the way. I'm hoping that year two turns out to be just as fun, creative, and rewarding.

Thanks!  
Dave
