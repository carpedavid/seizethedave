Giant stack of Moleskine notebooks

Over the past five years or so, I've accumulated lots of notebooks, pens, and ink that are never likely to see use. Sometimes, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, so to speak, and I over-purchased. Sometimes, I just got distracted by whatever new product I had just stumbled upon. In the case of the giant stack of Moleskine notebooks pictured above, it was the latter.

I started feeding my fountain pen addiction on Moleskines, which are perfectly fine general notebooks, but then quickly moved to paper that is more fountain pen friendly. As a result, I have lots of extra notebooks. This stack includes:

- Three regular size (5" x 8.25") sketchbooks
- One regular size grid-lined notebook
- One regular size blank notebook
- One regular size ruled notebook
- One regular size address book
- One regular size recipe journal
- One set of regular size ruled volant journals (flexible cover)
- One pocket size ruled cahier (paper cover)
- One pocket size ruled notebook

The address book, recipe journal, volant journals, cahier, and pocket size ruled notebook have been opened so that I could check them out, but all remain unused. In examining these years-old notebooks, I discovered that elastic on some of the books seemed to get loose over time, even without any use. Otherwise, they're in new condition.

Since I'm not likely to ever get around to using these notebooks, I am giving them away! To enter yourself, simply leave a comment below sometime before midnight EDT on Tuesday 8/16. I'll use a random number generator to pick a winner. Please make sure that the account you use to leave the comment has a method of contact so that I can coordinate delivery of your prize.

Fine print: to make sure that shipping costs are reasonable, this contest is only open to residents of the continental US.

UPDATE: we have a winner! PeppWaves03, the random number generator chose you!
