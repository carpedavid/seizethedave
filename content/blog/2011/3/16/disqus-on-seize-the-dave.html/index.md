Back in the day, when Seize the Dave was hosted on tumblr, I used disqus to power the comments. At the time it was the only option for tumblogs, but it always struck me as a good service that was easy to use and easy to comment with. When I moved the blog to Blogger, I decided to give the native Blogger comments a shot to see how they worked, and then promptly forgot about disqus.

Fortunately, my memory was jogged by Brian over at Ink Nouveau (another Blogger blog) who just [implemented the disqus commenting system](http://www.inknouveau.com/2011/03/disqus-now-on-ink-nouveau.html) himself. It is far better than the native Blogger comment system. Therefore, you will now see disqus powering comments here on Seize the Dave.

Hopefully, it provides for a much better commenting experience.
