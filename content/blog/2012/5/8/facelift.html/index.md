I've grown weary of Blogger's limitations, so I decided to move to a hosted blog at [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/). As you can see, the site has received a bit of a facelift in the process. I'm still working on getting Disqus put in place for comments, but am pleased that Squarespace was able to pull all of the comments over into its own system.

Please feel free to take a look around and let me know what you think.
