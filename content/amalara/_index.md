Through Amalara Game Studio, I design, write, and publish table-top role-playing games and the systems that power them. I focus on producing games that reward creativity, heroism, and teamwork, even though some of them are supposed to be scary and most can be played solo.

* [Heroic Tales](https://www.heroictalesrpg.com) - the core mechanics.
* [Wendigo](https://www.heroictalesrpg.com/wendigo) - a solo, journaling RPG about being chased through a dark and dangerous forest by a mysterious creature.
* [Underground](/amalara/underground/) - in this short, two-page TTRPG of urban fantasy powered by the Push system.
