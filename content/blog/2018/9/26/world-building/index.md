One of the most enjoyable parts of being creative - whether that be writing a short story or developing a video game - is building the world behind the narrative. I love the process of world building, and have put together many cohesive worlds for projects that I’ve never tackled for one reason or another. I’ve got a ton of material sitting around that could be useful to others - whether to act as inspiration or to use directly.

Therefore I’m going to start posting some of that content here, starting with a world that I introduced in the D&D adventure, Diamond Gulch, a fantasy/western setting called [Silver City](/silver-city-chronicles). Then I’ll post content from the [Land of the Crane](/land-of-the-crane/), a fantasy setting inspired by anime, manga, and kung-fu movies; Tangled Webs, a fantasy setting filled with elves, dwarves, and goblins; Archipelago, a space fantasy setting; Four Ton Mantis, a sci-fi setting inspired by the jazz age; Resonant Destiny, a sci-fi setting involving big data and magic; and others.

Some of these settings were created for tabletop role playing games, others for video games, and still others for short stories and novels. In each case, I will be presenting the settings in a system neutral fashion. You will not need knowledge of any particular game system to make use of them. If you have any questions about any of the material that I post, I’ll be happy to answer.
