I have noticed that, whenever I am away from the site for an extended period of time, my traffic seems to go up. It's an odd behavior that I can't quite explain, but I'm not complaining too much.

Well, hello to all of my new visitors - feel free to look around. I've got lots of [ink reviews](/search/label/ink%20reviews), [poetry](/search/label/poetry), and [fiction](/search/label/short%20stories) lying about. To all of my existing readers - I'm still here - I've just been busy and experiencing a bit of a creative drought. You should see more from me soon!
