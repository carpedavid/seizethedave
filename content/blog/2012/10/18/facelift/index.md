Long-time readers will no doubt notice a change in the look and feel of Seize the Dave. I've been using Squarespace to host my site for the past year or so (after a move from tumblr to Blogger), and they recently released a new version of their platform. Therefore, I've taken the plunge and upgraded from version 5 to version 6. Along with updated tools, the new platform comes with spiffy new templates, one of which you now see applied here.

I'll likely be adding a few splashes of color, as the current theme is a bit too sedate for my tastes, but otherwise I'm pretty happy with the results.

While I've double-checked most of the content to make sure that it transitioned correctly, I'd appreciate you [letting me know](mailto:carpedavid@gmail.com?subject=seize the dave) if you find something that didn't.
