You may have noticed fewer pen and ink related posts here as of late. It's not for lack of desire on my part. In October, I started graduate school (after more than a decade of being out of academia), and most of my discretionary time has been spent reading and writing coursework. I'm still able to get a post in here or there, and I have aÂ _ton_ of items to review, but it's just going to take a bit longer than planned.

In the meantime, the Land of the Crane series has enough material to run into May. I'm in between the Fall and Spring semesters, so I'm hoping that I'll have some time to either finish the review of J. Herbin Bleu Pervenche that I've got lying on my desk or the next installment of [Scarlett's adventures with the paranormal](/the-sacred-and-the-profane).

So, I'm still here and still motivated - just busy.
