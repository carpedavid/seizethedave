If I had a dog named Goliath  
There’s nothing that we wouldn’t do  
We’d spend every day together and play  
Together forever, we two

We’d climb to the top of a mountain  
And swim to the floor of the sea  
We’d sail away for a year and a day  
Together, Goliath and me

If I had a dog named Goliath  
There’s nowhere that we wouldn’t go  
We’d fly to the moon in a big red balloon  
And ski in the Antarctic snow

Goliath and I would be best friends  
And best friends forever we’d be  
As everyone knows, other friends come and go  
But Goliath would always love me
