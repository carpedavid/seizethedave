## üèÜ Honorable Mentions

These are apps I used to use and would still recommend, but simply don't fit my needs at the moment.

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - The gold standard of app launchers/multi-tools. I used this extensively before switching to Raycast, which has more of a developer orientation.
* [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - Window management. Replaced by Hookshot.
* [Nova](https://nova.app/) - Code editor and extremely capable text editor for HTML, CSS, Javascript, Php, Python, Markdown, etc... I'm now using VS Code pretty much exclusively, now.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) - One of the most powerful task management apps in existence. I have recently switched back to Apple Reminders.
* [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) - A lovely color picker. Which I pretty much never actually used. Still lovely, though!
* [Tooth Fairy](https://c-command.com/toothfairy/) - Manage Bluetooth devices from the menu bar *easily*. Much of what I used it for is built into Monterey now.
* [Workspaces](https://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) - Lets you launch multiple apps, files, URLs *per project*. As of Monterey, I have replaced this with Shortcuts. But if you want an app that's way easier to use than shortcuts, this is it.

## üï∏Ô∏è This Site

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static site generation built using Go.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Jamstack hosting.
